        🎉 50/50! You didn’t just ace it—you obliterated it! If there was a quiz Olympics, you’d be walking home with gold. I’m honestly starting to suspect you have some sort of secret cheat code. 🏅💯

        Almost perfect, but it’s like you tripped over the finish line. You could’ve nailed it if you just focused for 5 more seconds. Still, you're clearly in the top tier. Keep it up, quiz master! 💪😜

        Hmm, So, half of you tried, and the other half was still thinking about dinner. You’re not failing, but you’re not exactly winning either. Time to step up your game before the next round of questions! 😆🍔

        Did you even read the questions ?, or were you just guessing what sounded nice? At this point, the quiz is laughing at you. But hey, it's all about learning, right? Better luck next time! 💪

        😂 Zero! Not a single point? You didn’t even try, did you? The quiz was probably more confused by your lack of answers than you were by the questions. Seriously, you didn’t just fail, you obliterated your chance to pass. At this rate, I’m wondering if you even knew there was a quiz. Next time, try to at least pretend to care. 🤦‍♂️
